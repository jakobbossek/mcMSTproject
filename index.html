<h1 id="home">Design of New Mutation Operators for the Multi-Criteria Minimum Spanning Tree Problem</h1>

<p>A spanning tree of an weighted, undirected and connected graph G = (V, E, c) is a minimally connected subgraph T = (V, E') of G. I.e., there is exactly one way between each pair of nodes in T. A spanning tree T is termed <em>minimal spanning tree</em> (MST) if there is no spanning tree T' of G with lower sum of edge weights. The MST problem, i.e., finding a minimal spanning tree algorithmically, is a computationally easy problem. Famous algorithms, e.g., Prim's algorithm, find a MST in polynomial time. However, in real-world applications one is frequently confronted with intrinsically multi-objective problems with >= 2 conflicting objectives which shall be minimized simultaneously. Hence, the <em>multi-criteria minimum spanning tree problem (mcMST)</em> is of utmost practical relevance.

In our work we analyse Pareto-optimal solutions of mcMST problems statistically and use the gained insights -- as well as theoretical knowledge about the mcMST -- to develop and evaluate a new mutation operator based on subtree replacement.

We wrapped our instance generation process and implementation of evolutionary multi-objective algorithms for the mcMST problem in a package for the statistical programming language R.
